# Nursing Home Quality Improvement

## Overview
This project aims to create a data dashboard that helps monitor and improve the quality of care in nursing homes across various states. The dashboard uses multiple measures, including clinical outcomes, functional status of patients or systems, satisfaction of stakeholders, and costs, to provide a comprehensive view of the performance of nursing homes.

## Data Sources
The dataset used in this project is derived from the Nursing Home Compare State Averages, which provides extensive information on various performance metrics for nursing homes.

## Measures
The project focuses on the following measures:
- **Clinical Outcomes**: 
  - Percent of long-stay residents whose need for help with ADLs increased
  - Percent of long-stay residents who lose too much weight
  - Percent of long-stay residents with a catheter inserted and left in the bladder
  - Percent of long-stay residents with a urinary tract infection
- **Functional Status**:
  - Reported nurse aide staffing hours per resident per day
  - Reported LPN staffing hours per resident per day
  - Reported RN staffing hours per resident per day
  - Reported total nurse staffing hours per resident per day
  - Total nursing staff turnover
- **Satisfaction of Stakeholders**:
  - Registered nurse turnover
  - Number of administrators who left the nursing home
- **Costs**:
  - Number of fines
  - Fine amount in dollars

## Visualizations
The data dashboard includes the following visualizations:
- **Histogram**: Distribution of clinical outcomes such as the percentage of long-stay residents whose need for help with ADLs increased.
- **Box Plot**: Distribution of clinical outcomes by state.
- **Violin Plot**: Distribution of clinical outcomes by state.
- **Pair Plot**: Relationships between selected clinical outcomes.
- **Joint Plot**: Relationship between the percentage of long-stay residents with UTIs and catheter use.
- **Scatter Plot**: State-wise distribution of clinical outcomes.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Correlation between cost-related measures.
- **Bar Plot**: State-wise distribution of residents losing control of their bowel.
- **Line Plot**: Trends over time for various measures.

## Steps Taken
1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - Loaded the dataset using pandas.
   - Checked for missing values and confirmed that no data cleaning was necessary.
   - Displayed summary statistics to understand the dataset better.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Created various plots using seaborn and matplotlib to visualize the data and identify trends and relationships.
   - Used pair plots, joint plots, violin plots, histograms, correlation heatmaps, box plots, scatter plots, and bar plots to present the data comprehensively.

3. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Combined the visualizations into a coherent dashboard using Jupyter Notebook.

## Insights and Recommendations
- **Clinical Outcomes**: Variability in clinical outcomes suggests the need for targeted interventions in states with poorer performance.
- **Functional Status**: Adequate staffing is crucial for better resident outcomes, and states with lower staffing levels should reassess their resource allocation.
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: High turnover rates indicate potential dissatisfaction, necessitating strategies to improve job satisfaction and retention.
- **Costs**: States with higher staff turnover tend to incur more fines, highlighting the need for better compliance and staff management.

## Tools and Resources
- **Python Libraries**: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
- **Software**: Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code
- **Data Source**: Nursing Home Compare State Averages dataset

## Conclusion
The data dashboard provides a valuable tool for monitoring and improving the quality of care in nursing homes. By leveraging the insights gained from the dashboard, stakeholders can implement targeted interventions, optimize resource allocation, enhance stakeholder engagement, and manage costs more effectively.

## Usage
To run the code and generate the dashboard:
1. Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
